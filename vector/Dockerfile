# Init Jobs/Pods often start a Vector Sidecar Container which collects the logs.
# As soon as an Init Container is done it'll need to tell the Vector sidecar that it can now also stop
# This happens by writing a "shutdown file" in a shared volume
# See https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/blob/23.4.1/rust/operator-binary/src/airflow_db_controller.rs#L269 for an example
# The Vector container waits for this file to appear and this waiting happens using `inotifywait` which comes from the `inotify-tools` package
