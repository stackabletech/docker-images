# Manual job to run the preflight checks and possibly submit the results
# to the RedHat Technology Portal.
#
# This job used to be part of the dev and release workflow but now it's an
# independent manually triggered workflow.
#
# The primary reason for this is that it made the release process unnecessary
# chaotic. The RH tech portal is notoriously unstable, and in cases where it
# failed to respond, a way to re-run the preflight checks was necessary.
# But the preflight checks were trigerred only after a successful release
# workflow, which it's self was only triggered by a new tag.
#
# As you can imagine, retagging this repository just to force a new round
# of possibly unsuccessful checks was not very productive.
