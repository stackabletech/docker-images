## Prerequisites

* [Stackable Image Tools](https://github.com/stackabletech/image-tools) (`pip install image-tools-stackabletech`)
* Docker including the [`buildx` plugin](https://github.com/docker/buildx)
* Optional: [OpenShift preflight tool](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/openshift-preflight) to verify an image for OpenShift

## Build Product Images

Product images are published to the `docker.stackable.tech` registry under the `stackable` organization by default.

### Build single products locally

To build and push product images to the default repository use this command:

```sh
bake --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev --push
```

This will build images for Apache ZooKeeper versions as defined in the `conf.py` file, tag them with the `image-version` 0.0.0-dev and push them to the registry.

You can select a specific version of a product to build using the syntax `product=version` e.g. to build Hive 3.1.3 you can use this command:

```sh
bake --product hive=3.1.3 -i 0.0.0-dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> `-i` is the shorthand for `--image` (i.e. the resulting image tag)

### Build all products locally

To build all products in all versions locally you can use this command

```sh
bake --image-version 0.0.0-dev
```

### Build everything in GitHub

The GitHub action called `Build (and optionally publish) 0.0.0-dev images` can be triggered manually to do build all images in all versions.
When triggered manually it will _not_ push the images to the registry.

## Verify Product Images

To verify if Apache Zookeeper validate against OpenShift preflight, run:

```sh
check-container --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev
```

## ubi8-rust-builder / ubi9-rust-builder

These images are meant to be used in multi-stage builds as a base image for projects building Rust projects.
They are automatically rebuilt and pushed every night and also on every push to the main branch, in addition a build can be triggered using GitHub Actions.

The image will run `cargo build --release` in the current context and copy all binaries to an `/app` directory.

This will bake in the current stable Rust version at the time this image was built, which means it should be rebuilt (and tagged) for every release of Rust.

## Example usage

```dockerfile
FROM docker.stackable.tech/ubi9-rust-builder AS builder

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal AS operator
LABEL maintainer="Stackable GmbH"

# Update image
RUN microdnf update \
  && microdnf install \
    shadow-utils \
  && rm -rf /var/cache/yum

COPY --from=builder /app/stackable-zookeeper-operator /

RUN groupadd -g 1000 stackable && adduser -u 1000 -g stackable -c 'Stackable Operator' stackable

USER 1000:1000

ENTRYPOINT ["/stackable-zookeeper-operator"]
```
