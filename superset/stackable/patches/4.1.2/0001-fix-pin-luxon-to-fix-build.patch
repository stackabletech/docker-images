Subject: fix: pin luxon to fix build

For some reason npm tries to use a newer version of luxon than the version in the lock file. I suspect this might be related to how npm before version 11 handles workspace dependencies in lock files. The luxon version is set to 3.5.0 now to prevent npm from trying to select a newer version, so that the same packages as in the original Superset build are used.
