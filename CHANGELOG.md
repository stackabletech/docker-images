# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- hadoop: Add all necessary components to the image to mount HDFS using FUSE ([#400])
- java-base: Add needed tzdata-java package ([#425]).
- testing-tools: Add java, tzdata-java, unzip ([#464], [#465], [#466]).

- opa: add version 0.57.0 ([#471]).
- opa: add new version upload script ([#471]).

- zookeeper: add version 3.8.3 ([#470]).
- zookeeper: add upload script ([#470]).

### Changed

- Extract image tools their own [repository](https://github.com/stackabletech/image-tools) ([#437])
- Bump ubi8-rust-builder toolchain to 1.71.0 ([#419]).
- BREAKING: Upgrade Vector in all product images to version 0.33.0. The
  integration tests of the operators must be adapted because the metric
  `processedEventsTotal` was replaced by `receivedEventsTotal` ([#429],
  [#479]).
- BREAKING: Use RPM instead of tar.gz for Vector. Because of that, the
  location of the Vector executable changed, and the operator-rs version
  0.45.0 or newer is required ([#429]).
- spark-k8s: Rework spark images to build on top of java-base image.  This fixes the missing tzdata-java package in 0.0.0-dev versions ([#434]).

- airflow: Updated git-sync to 3.6.8 ([#431]).
- airflow: Updated statsd-exporter to 0.24, this was accidentally moved to a very old version previously (0.3.0) ([#431]).
- airflow: Added wrapper script to allow the triggering of pre/post hook actions ([#435]).

### Removed

- airflow: Remove unused environment variable `AIRFLOW_UID` ([#429]).
- java-base: Remove hard-coded JVM security properties containing DNS cache settings. Going forward operators will configure DNS cache settings ([#433])
- pyspark-k8s: The PySpark image has been removed completely. Python is now installed with the Spark image ([#436])
- Removed all product specific changelogs and updated the root file ([#440])

- opa: removed versions 0.27.1, 0.28.0, 0.37.2, 0.41.0, 0.45.0 ([#471]).
- zookeeper: removed versions 3.5.8, 3.6.3, 3.7.0, 3.8.0 ([#470]).

- druid: Support for version `26.0.0` ([#384]).
- hadoop: Add krb5-workstation and openssl packages - needed for Kerberos support ([#347]).
- hive: Added `jackson-dataformat-xml-2.7.9.jar` (2.3.9) and `jackson-dataformat-xml-2.12.3.jar` (3.1.3) for XmlFormat conversion for logging ([#293]).
- nifi: Support for version `1.20.0`, `1.21.0` ([#365]).

### Changed

- nifi: Upgraded to the base image java-base:11-stackable0.3.0. The java-base image
  contains a layer which provides Vector. The creation of the stackable user
  and group happens in the stackable-base layer and is therefore removed from
  this image ([#297]).

- opa: Upgraded to the vector base image ([#329]).
- opa: Support for version `0.51.0`` ([#382]).

- zookeeper: Make soft link for `jmx-exporter` e.g. `jmx_prometheus_javaagent-<version>.jar` -> `jmx_prometheus_javaagent.jar` ([#381]).
