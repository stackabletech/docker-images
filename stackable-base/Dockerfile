# We configure microdnf to not install weak dependencies in this file
# Not doing this caused the content of images to become unpredictable because
# based on which packages get updated by `microdnf update` new weak dependencies
# might be installed that were not present earlier (the ubi8 base image doesn't
# seem to install weak dependencies)
# This also affects the packages that are installed in our Dockerfiles (java as prime
# example).
