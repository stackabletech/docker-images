  # Warning: Use WORKDIR to switch to a directory.

  # Reason: We use WORKDIR where appropriate and `cd` otherwise to condense RUN blocks, this warning is annoying

  # Warning: Always tag the version of an image explicitly.
  # https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3006
  # Reason: We use buildx which handles the build graph, no explicit image tags necessary

  # Warning: Use the -y switch to avoid manual input dnf install -y <package>
  # https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3038
  # Reason: We set `assumeyes=True` in dnf.conf in our base image
  - DL3038

  # Warning: Specify version with dnf install -y <package>-<version>
  # https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3041
  # Reason: It's good advice, but we're not set up to pin versions just yet

  # Warning: Set the SHELL option -o pipefail before RUN with a pipe in it

  # Reason: I've yet to see this being useful, where this happens we usually have no way to actually provide the file

  # Use cd ... || exit in case cd fails.

  # In POSIX sh, [[ ]] is undefined.
