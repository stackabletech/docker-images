# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added NiFi version `1.20.0`, `1.21.0` ([#365]).

### Changed

- Upgraded to the base image java-base:11-stackable0.3.0. The java-base image
  contains a layer which provides Vector. The creation of the stackable user
  and group happens in the stackable-base layer and is therefore removed from
  this image ([#297]).
