# disables the vulnerable feature

# For earlier versions this script removes the .class file that contains the
# vulnerable code.
# TODO: This can be restricted to target only versions which do not honor the environment

# Ensure no vulnerable files are left over
# This will currently report vulnerable files being present, as it also alerts on
# SocketNode.class, which we do not remove with our scripts.
# Further investigation will be needed whether this should also be removed.
