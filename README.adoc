= Stackable Docker Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles and scripts to build base images for use within Stackable.

== ubi8-rust-builder

This image is meant to be used in multi-stage builds as a base image for projects building Rust projects.

The image will run `cargo build --release` in the current context and copy all binaries to an `/app` directory.

This will bake in the current stable Rust version at the time this image was built which means it should be rebuilt (and tagged) for every release of Rust.

.Example usage
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM docker.stackable.tech/ubi8-rust-builder AS builder

FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal AS operator
LABEL maintainer="Stackable GmbH"

# Update image
RUN microdnf update --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=ubi-8-baseos-rpms --enablerepo=ubi-8-baseos-rpms -y \
  && rm -rf /var/cache/yum \
  && microdnf install --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=ubi-8-appstream-rpms --enablerepo=ubi-8-baseos-rpms shadow-utils -y \
  && rm -rf /var/cache/yum

COPY --from=builder /app/stackable-zookeeper-operator /

RUN groupadd -g 1000 stackable && adduser -u 1000 -g stackable -c 'Stackable Operator' stackable

== Build Product Images

Product images are published to the `docker.stackable.tech` registry under the `stackable` organization.

Prerequisites:

* Stackable Image Tools (`pip install image-tools-stackabletech`) https://github.com/stackabletech/image-tools 
* Docker including the `buildx` plugin: https://github.com/docker/buildx

To build and push product images to the default repository, use the `build_product_images.py` like this:

    bake --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev --push

This will build images for Apache ZooKeeper versions as defined in the `conf.py` file and tag them with the `image-version` 0.0.0-dev

The GitHub action called `Product images` can be triggered manually to do the same but not on the local machine.

== Verify Product Images

Prerequisites:

* Stackable Image Tools (`pip install image-tools-stackabletech`) https://github.com/stackabletech/image-tools
* OpenShift preflight tool: https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/openshift-preflight

To verify if Apache Zookeeper validate against OpenShift preflight, run:

    check-container --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev
