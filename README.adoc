= Stackable Docker Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles and scripts to build base images for use within Stackable.

== Prerequisites

* Stackable Image Tools (`pip install image-tools-stackabletech`) https://github.com/stackabletech/image-tools
* Docker including the `buildx` plugin: https://github.com/docker/buildx
* Optional: https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/openshift-preflight[OpenShift preflight tool] to verify an image for OpenShift

== Build Product Images

Product images are published to the `docker.stackable.tech` registry under the `stackable` organization by default.

To build and push product images to the default repository use this command:

    bake --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev --push

This will build images for Apache ZooKeeper versions as defined in the `conf.py` file, tag them with the `image-version` 0.0.0-dev and push them to the registry.

You can select a specific version of a product to build using the syntax `product=version` e.g. to build Hive 3.1.3 you can use this command:

    bake --product hive=3.1.3 -i 0.0.0-dev

NOTE: `-i` is the shorthand for `--image` (i.e. the resulting image tag)

The GitHub action called `Product images` can be triggered manually to do the same but not on the local machine.

== Verify Product Images

To verify if Apache Zookeeper validate against OpenShift preflight, run:

    check-container --product zookeeper --image 0.0.0-dev

== ubi8-rust-builder

This image is meant to be used in multi-stage builds as a base image for projects building Rust projects.

The image will run `cargo build --release` in the current context and copy all binaries to an `/app` directory.

This will bake in the current stable Rust version at the time this image was built, which means it should be rebuilt (and tagged) for every release of Rust.
