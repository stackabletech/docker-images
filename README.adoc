= Stackable Docker Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles and scripts to build base images for use within Stackable.

== ubi8-rust-builder

This image is meant to be used in multi-stage builds as a base image for projects building Rust projects.

The image will run `cargo build --release` in the current context and copy all binaries to an `/app` directory.

This will bake in the current stable Rust version at the time this image was built which means it should be rebuilt (and tagged) for every release of Rust.
