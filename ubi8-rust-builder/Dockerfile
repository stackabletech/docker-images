# Deprecation notice: Stackable has moved to UBI9 as of its 24.7 release
# This builder is kept around and updated until the last SDP release is EOL that uses UBI8 (which is 24.3) so we'll remove this sometime in the summer of 2025

# Find the latest version at https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8-minimal/5c64772edd19c77a158ea216?container-tabs=gti
# IMPORTANT: Be sure to use the Manifest List Digest for multi-arch support

# Sets the default shell to Bash with strict error handling and robust pipeline processing.
# "-e": Exits immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
# "-u": Treats unset variables as an error, preventing unexpected behavior from undefined variables.
# "-o pipefail": Causes a pipeline to return the exit status of the last command in the pipe that failed, ensuring errors in any part of a pipeline are not ignored.
# "-c": Allows the execution of commands passed as a string
# This is automatically inherited in all other Dockerfiles that use this unless it is overwritten

# We configure microdnf to not install weak dependencies in this file
# Not doing this caused the content of images to become unpredictable because
# based on which packages get updated by `microdnf update` new weak dependencies
# might be installed that were not present earlier (the ubi base image doesn't
# seem to install weak dependencies)
# This also affects the packages that are installed in our Dockerfiles (java as prime
# example).
